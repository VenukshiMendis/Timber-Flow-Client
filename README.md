# TimberFlow: Timber Permit Management System

## Overview

**TimberFlow** is a web application designed to streamline and automate the process of obtaining timber cutting and transport permits in Sri Lanka. The system replaces the existing manual and time-consuming process with a more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly online platform. 

Citizens can submit applications and required documents digitally, while relevant authorities such as the **Grama Sewaka** and **Divisional Secretariat** can approve, reject, or manage these requests. The platform allows users to track the status of their requests in real time, receive timely notifications, and download approved permits directly from the platform.
