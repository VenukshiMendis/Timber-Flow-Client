# TimberFlow: Timber Permit Management System

TimberFlow is a web application designed to streamline and automate the process of obtaining permits for timber cutting and transport in Sri Lanka. This project aims to replace the existing manual and time-consuming process with an efficient online system. The application enables citizens to submit applications and required documents digitally and facilitates online approvals from relevant authorities such as the Grama Sewaka and Divisional Secretariat. Also, this application provides citizens with the ability to track the status of their requests in real time, receive timely notifications upon approval, and conveniently download the issued permits directly from the platform.
